  <p>Dear <%= donorName %>,</p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your willingness to donate blood and support those in need. We truly appreciate your generous spirit.
  </p>

  <p>
    After reviewing your recent donation request, we regret to inform you that we are currently unable to accept your donation
    <% if (reason === 'interval') { %>
      because the time since your last donation has not yet reached the required minimum of 3 months.
    <% } else if (reason === 'test') { %>
      due to your recent blood test results, which did not meet the eligibility requirements.
    <% } else { %>
      for one of the standard eligibility reasons.
    <% } %>
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any questions or would like more details, please feel free to contact us. We hope to welcome your donation again in the future when eligible.
